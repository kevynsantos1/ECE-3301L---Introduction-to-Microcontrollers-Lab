In this lab I learned how to use ADC and Interrupts. In this program, a 10k ohm potentiometer is used to show how our ADC pin works. This ADC reading is set up so that the higher the value, the more LEDS light up. First
the input/output ports are setup. Then I setup the ADC pin using the proper registers. Then configure the ADC interrupt. In the interrupt, different sets of LEDS turn on for different voltage ratings.
