In this lab we learned how to use ADC and Interrupts. In this program, we use a 10k ohm potentiometer to show how our ADC pin works. We set this ADC reading up so that the higher the value, the more LEDS light up. We first setup our 
input/output ports. Then we have to setup our ADC pin using the proper registers. Then we configure the ADC interrupt.
