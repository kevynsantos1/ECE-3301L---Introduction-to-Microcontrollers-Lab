In the first part of this lab I learn how to use LCD screens. I use a header and .c file to be able to do things such as configure the screen and write to the LCD. In this program I create a counter from 0-15 and once it hits its max value, it 
resets to 0. Once counter is reset to 0, I have another variable called "round" that is incremented. These two values are displayed on the LCD and updated accordingly.
