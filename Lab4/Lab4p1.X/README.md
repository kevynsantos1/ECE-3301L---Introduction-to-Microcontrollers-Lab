In the first part of this lab we learn how to use LCD screens. We use a header and .c file to be able to do things such as configure the screen and write to it. In this program we create a counter from 0-15 and once it hits its max value, it 
resets to 0. Once counter is reset to 0, we have another variable called round that is incremented. These two values are displayed on the LCD and updated accordingly.
