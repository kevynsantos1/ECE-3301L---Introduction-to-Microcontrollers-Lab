In this program we use 2 seven segment displays to make a counter from 0-60. We use one counter from 0-10, and once it hits 10 it resets to 0 and increments the next counter. This is done till the second counter hits 6, once it hits 6 it is 
reset to 0. We use an array of hexadeximal values so that the counters can send those sets of pins high to display the proper number on the seven-segment display.
