In this program we are making a system using the DHT11 sensor. This sensor can read humidity and temperature levels. There are functions to make this program as simple as possible. The StartSetup sends a low signal for 18ms and then a high signal for 40us to let the sensor know we want to 
start reading. The SensorResponse waits for the sensor to send a signal back letting the microcontroller know it heard the request to start reading humidity and temperature. The CollectData function reads 8 bits of data total and for every iteration shifts a bit so that it reads the value
correctly. It is important to note that it reads 8 bits of humidity integer, then 8 bits of humidity fraction, then 8 bits of temperature integer, then 8 bits of temperature fraction, and lastly 8 bits of the totalvalue so that we ensure the readings are correct.
