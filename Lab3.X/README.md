In this program I designed a mock traffic intersection. There were 4 traffic lights on a sequence. West and East lights were green for 6 seconds, then Yellow for 3 seconds, then Red for the rest of the time. North and 
South lights are Red while west/east lights aren't red, then Green for 6 seconds, then yellow for 3. Then it is looped all over again
